## Code from our first lesson in JavaScript

Code from our first leson where we learned about variables, values, data types and operators. We also learned how to link a javascript file to the HTML document.
If you have any question about a certain part in the code copy paste it into our slack channel and ask your question. I'll get back to you as soon as possible :)
